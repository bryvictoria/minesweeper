# minesweeper
A simple minesweeper made in java. 

If you're a student with a minesweeper game assignment  or someone trying to learn coding in java, feel free to use this code as reference. I'll be glad if somehow the codes in this program helped you. I did create this game for a friend who is an IT student. This program is for their OOP subject so OOP principles were somehow used in this. Feel free to edit something or suggest something.
